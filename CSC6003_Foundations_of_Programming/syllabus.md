**Instructor:** Ares Canetti - [CanettiAM@merrimack.edu](mailto:CanettiAM@merrimack.edu)

## Course Description
An introduction to programming concepts. Emphasis will be placed on algorithms, test-driven design, development, and structured programming in the Python language. Topics include:
- Program development
- Modularity
- Variables and data types (numbers, strings, arrays, lists)
- Basic programming concepts (conditionals, Boolean algebra, loops, I/O operations)

Open-source texts and resources will be used throughout the course.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
1. Understand basic data manipulation, including variables, data types, and files.
2. Understand basic flow control, including if statements, loops, and functions.
3. Understand advanced data types such as strings, arrays, and objects.
4. Understand and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts: data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
5. Understand the use of recursion in methods and classic data structures.

## Course Expectations
Students should expect to spend at least **10 hours per week** on coursework outside of class, including reading, studying, and problem-solving tasks.
