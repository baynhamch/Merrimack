# Assignment 01-Worksheet Task #1 and Task #2

### Task #1

Create a program that generates a random array of 10,000 elements with equal number of 0's and 1's and then implement the randomized Las Vegas algorithm that searches for an element holding a 1

Your program should output the position of the first 1 found, plus the number of tries before finding it.

 

### Task #2

Create a program that generates a random array of 10,000 elements with equal number of 0's and 1's and then implement the randomized Monte Carlo algorithm that searches for an element holding a 1

- Set k equal to 10

- Your program should output the position of the first 1 found, plus the number of tries before finding it or a message stating that it did not find the 1 after k attempts.

#### Rubric

| Criteria | Pts |
| --- | --- |
| Random arrays generated according to the specifications of the prompt. | 20|
| Las Vegas algorithm correctly implemented. The Las Vegas function should always return an index of a 1 from the input array.| 35 |
| Monte Carlo algorithm correctly implemented. The Monte Carlo function should take two inputs: an array of 0s and 1s and an integer k, setting a limit to the amount of attempts at finding a 1. It should output either an index of the first 1 found or a message saying that all attempts have been exhausted. | 35 |
| Program flow control, comments, and documentation | 10 |
