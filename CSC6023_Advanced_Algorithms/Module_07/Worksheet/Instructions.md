# Module 07: Assignment 01 - Worksheet Tasks 01

Create a program that asks repeatedly the user positive integer numbers and stores/deletes it in an AVL tree (use the code saw in the third example)

If the user enters a number already in the tree, delete it

If the user enters a number that is not in the tree, insert it

After each insertion/deletion, the program prints the current tree using the printHelper method

When the user enters a non-positive integer, the program ends

Besides the implementation of your program, write a short report describing your experiences.

 

This program must be your own, do not use someone else’s code

Any specific questions about it, please bring to the Office hours meeting this Monday or contact me by email. This is a challenging program to make sure you are mastering your Python programming skills, as well as your asymptotic analysis understanding. Don’t be shy with your questions!
