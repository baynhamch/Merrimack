# Module 07: Assignment 02 - Project 07 Dijsktra's Algorithm

- Create a program that implements the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm program with the Lord of the Rings example case

- You will need to represent the map of Middle Earth as an adjacency matrix and then feed it into the program

- Your program should print the shortest path from the Shire to various points in Middle Earth including the paths and the distances along the way.

-Since the code has already been written for you, the main challenge will be ensuring that you understand how the input works and should be written exactly.
